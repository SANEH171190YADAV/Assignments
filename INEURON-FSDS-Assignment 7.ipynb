    "Q1.\tWhat is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "Ans: re. compile() function\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.\tWhy do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "Ans: Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3.\tWhat is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "Ans: It will return the mathed object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.\tFrom a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "Ans: group() method is used to return the matched string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.\tIn the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "Ans: Group 0 gives us whole macthed objects, group 1 return first set of parenthesis and group 2 gives second set of parentheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.\tIn standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "Ans: we can saperate a period and parentheses using backslash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7.\tThe findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "Ans: If the regular expression has a group, a list of tuples of the string is returned otherwise a list of strings is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8.\tIn standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "Ans: either Or between two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9.\tIn regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "Ans: ‘The’ character means either match zero or one of the preceding group or be used to signify nongreedy matching. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "Ans: + means matching one or more and * means matching zero or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10.\tWhat is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "Ans: {4} means if 4 is matched or not. {4,5} means to match between 4 and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11.\tWhat do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "Ans: \\d- single digit, \\w – a word, s- space character\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12.\tWhat do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "Ans: \\D- means single charater but not digit, \\W- a word, \\S- space charater\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13.\tWhat is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "Ans: .*?  is a greedy match and .* is non greedy match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14.\tWhat is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "Ans: [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15.\tWhat is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "Ans: re.IGNORECASE\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16.\tWhat does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "Ans: The . character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?\n",
    "Ans: 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "Ans: it allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile().\n",
    "\n",
    "Q20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following:\n",
    "'42'\n",
    "'1,234'\n",
    "'6,368,745'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "'12,34,567' (which has only two digits between the commas)\n",
    "'1234' (which lacks commas)\n",
    "Ans: re.compile(r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$') will create this regex, but other regex strings can produce a similar regular expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Q21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:\n",
    "'Haruto Watanabe'\n",
    "'Alice Watanabe'\n",
    "'RoboCop Watanabe'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "'haruto Watanabe' (where the first name is not capitalized)\n",
    "'Mr. Watanabe' (where the preceding word has a nonletter character)\n",
    "'Watanabe' (which has no first name)\n",
    "'Haruto watanabe' (where Watanabe is not capitalized)\n",
    "Ans: re.compile(r'[A-Z][a-z]*\\sWatanable')\n",
    "\n",
    "Q22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:\n",
    "'Alice eats apples.'\n",
    "'Bob pets cats.'\n",
    "'Carol throws baseballs.'\n",
    "'Alice throws Apples.'\n",
    "'BOB EATS CATS.'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "'RoboCop eats apples.'\n",
    "'ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.'\n",
    "'Carol eats 7 cats.'\n",
    "Ans: re.compile(r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\\s(eats|pets|throws)\\s(apples|cats|baseballs)\\.', re.IGNORECASE)\n"
